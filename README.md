# Adaptive-Traffic-Management-System-Using-YOLOv8


Overview
This project proposes an Adaptive Traffic Management System that leverages YOLOv8 for real-time object detection. By dynamically adjusting traffic signal timings and control strategies based on real-time traffic conditions, this system aims to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and enhance road safety.

Features
Real-Time Traffic Analysis: Utilizes YOLOv8â€™s object detection capabilities to analyze vehicle density and movement in real time.
Dynamic Signal Adjustment: Signal timings adapt based on real-time traffic conditions to reduce idle time and enhance flow efficiency.
Congestion Reduction: Implements strategies to alleviate bottlenecks and reduce congestion on busy roads.
Enhanced Safety: Improves road safety by monitoring traffic patterns and adjusting signals accordingly.
